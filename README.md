<br> <br>

## Content 
The content of this is self explanatory. Each folder has the following structure name: `FEUP-<Subject>-<Type>`.  
For example, the folder `FEUP-BDAD-Proj` means that it contains the __project__ for the __BDAD__ subject.  
The types can be __TPS__ (that stands for theorical pratical exercises) and __Proj__ that contains the project(s) created in the subject.   
However, some projects have its own repository and may not follow the convention of folders.  For these ones I've created a list of content explaining them:  

| Name                     | Subject | Type | About                                          | Year |
